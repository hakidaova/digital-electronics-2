### Morse code

1. Listing of C code which repeats one "dot" and one "comma" (BTW, in Morse code it is letter `A`) on a LED. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow C guidelines:

```c
#define LED_GREEN PB5
#define SHORT_DELAY 250 // Delay in milliseconds
#ifndef F_CPU
# define F_CPU 16000000 // CPU frequency in Hz required for delay funcs
#endif
int main(void)
{
    // Set pin where on-board LED is connected as output
    pinMode(LED_GREEN, OUTPUT);

    // Infinite loop
    while (1)
    {
        // Generate a lettre `A` Morse code
        

        // WRITE YOUR CODE HERE


    }

    // Will never reach this
    return 0;
}
```

2. Scheme of Morse code application, i.e. connection of AVR device, LED, resistor, and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
